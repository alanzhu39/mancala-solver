Mancala Solver
- solver for Mancala (based on GamePigeon version rules)
- can select different modes (capture/avalanche, normal/random initialization)

TODO:
- avalanche mode (currently only implmementing capture mode)

In progress:
- central solver algorithm
  - mdtf
  - alpha beta w memory
  - iterative deepening
  - transposition table



3/17/23:
On LLM tools: these tools seem very strong.
- GitHub Copilot is suggesting really useful stuff and can provide very pertinent comments and code understanding as well.
  - eg. writing docstring for GameState struct
- ChatGPT is great for providing skeletons of what I want to implement and a good general structure of the codebase I want.
  - eg. today with the transposition table skeleton (great understanding of zobrist hash, and transposition table entries)
  - even its game state struct matched pretty well with my state struct

Components:
- game rules
- solver
  - endgame table
  - transposition table (search tree cache)
  - futility pruning
- CLI
